# mfe-svelte-attractions

Demo app to show the integration of attractions into a svelte app using webpack.
## start
```
npm install
npm start
```

## problem
'theme.scss' located in /src/css is not respected although the configuration in /ci/svelte.config.js seems ok.

1. the border should have a radius of 2em instead of 1.25em
2. the border color should be green
